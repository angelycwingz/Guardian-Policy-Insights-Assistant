# 🛡️ Guardian – Policy Insights Assistant

Guardian is an intelligent assistant designed to make **policy documents** and **policy research** more accessible and user-friendly.  
It enables users to **upload, analyze, and query policy documents**, while also offering a **web search powered by Exa and Cerebras** for external policy insights.  

Whether you’re analyzing a long PDF document or exploring policies across the web, Guardian provides **actionable summaries, key insights, and an interactive Q&A experience**.
